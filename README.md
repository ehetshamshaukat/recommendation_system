Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System, a web application that helps users discover movies based on their preferences and viewing history. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to recommend films tailored to individual tastes, making movie selection easier and more personalized.

### Features

	•	Personalized Recommendations: Receive movie suggestions based on your watching habits and preferences.
	•	Advanced Filtering: Search movies by genre, release year, and popularity.
	•	User Ratings and Reviews: Rate and review movies to improve future recommendations.
	•	Trending Movies: View lists of trending movies updated in real-time.
	•	Watchlist: Save your favorite movies to a personalized watchlist.

### Technology Stack

	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	•	Backend: Python (Flask/Django)
	•	Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL
	•	Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy
	•	Deployment: Docker, AWS (EC2, RDS)
	•	Version Control: Git, GitHub

### How It Works

	1.	Data Collection: Movie metadata (genre, cast, director, etc.) and user ratings are collected from an external API (like TMDB).
	2.	Model Training: A collaborative filtering algorithm or content-based filtering technique is used to predict user preferences.
	3.	Recommendation Engine: The model recommends movies based on user input, such as viewing history or selected genres.
	4.	User Interaction: Users can interact with the system by rating movies, viewing trending lists, and exploring movie details.
